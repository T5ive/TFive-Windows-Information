TFive Windows-Infomation is an open-source (GPLv3) written in C#. 

# FREE but NO SUPPORT
There's no support. Don't email me if you can't use it.

Instead, try to update Windows-Infomation by yourself. It's a lot easier than you think. If you can't, search the Internet and you should find a couple of forums where you can ask your question.
